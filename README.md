# Simple JWT example
Based on the excellent example from Erik Gillespie: https://github.com/technical-rex/spring-security-jwt

Check out his blog entry: http://technicalrex.com/2015/02/20/stateless-authentication-with-spring-security-and-jwt/ 

## Instructions 

On startup 3 users are being bootstrapped:

- tom / tomspw
- dick / dickspw
- harry / harriespw

Login as a user:

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username":"tom","password":"tomspw"}' http://localhost:8080/auth/login

Use the returned token:

    curl --header "X-AUTH-TOKEN: [token]" http://localhost:8080/api/greeting
    
For example:

    curl --header "X-AUTH-TOKEN: eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJtaWJlcyJ9.B-YTY1vIxXzrcB4GKjL0jAPSRBBKGcE7m9v9cVNQ72AzfSOb975Nc8SXrXDEzhaG6Xfbvb8JGHwuUMVUKH6Y5w" http://localhost:8080/api/greeting

The generated token expires after 60 minutes, after which the application should login again to obtain a new token. 


## Note

Because both the username and password are sent in clear text, you do **not** want to use this authentication mechanism over an unencrypted connection. Always use HTTPS.
